# Just Sustainability Design

Just Sustainability Design, JSD for short, is a framework for systems design practice, research, and pedagogy that privileges sustainability and justice and therefore, the asymmetric and uneven effects of systems design choices at a distance. JSD aims to bring about improvement, not just avoid damage. It is sensitive to the discursive nature of systems design and the dangers presented by misleading narratives that keep systems design practice captive to false consciousness. Because it centres on the concerns of sustainability and justice, JSD must attend to five important factors they raise:  **dispersal**, **uncertainty and ambiguity**, **fragmentation**, **power dynamics, and incommensurability**.

IT has a conflicted relationship with Just Sustainability so how can we design with it in mind? Learn about the origin of Just Sustainable Design (JSD) through Computing by delving into its concepts and critical principles.

"Insolvent: How to Reorient Computing for Just Sustainability" by Professor Christoph Becker breaks down how we can reorient design perspectives in computer science to better align with the values of sustainability and justice and why this change is needed in Computing.
