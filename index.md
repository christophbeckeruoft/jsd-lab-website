## What We Do and Why

{% capture text %}

The overarching theme of our group is to conduct **impactful research on designing information technology for sustainability and social justice, which converge in just sustainability**. The aim is often to enact meaningful change in tech to meet the urgent need for sustainability and social justice. 

We do that through a combination of:
1. critical examinations of the politics, values, and cognitive processes of design
2. the development of methods and tools for just sustainability design 
3. design projects to bring forth just sustainabilities in urban contexts
