### We want to change things. We have to change things.

## What We Do and Why

The overarching theme of our group is to conduct  **impactful research on designing information technology for sustainability and social justice, which converge in just sustainability**. The aim is often to enact meaningful change in tech to meet the urgent need for sustainability and social justice. 

We do that through a combination of:
1. critical examinations of the politics, values, and cognitive processes of design
2. the development of methods and tools for just sustainability design 
3. design projects to bring forth just sustainabilities in urban contexts

## Recent Projects
[Curbcut](https://toronto.curbcut.ca/)
Curbcut is a map-based data exploration and visualization tool designed to translate urban sustainability data into actionable knowledge for shaping sustainable cities. Initially developed and launched for Montreal at McGill University, a Toronto version is under development led by the UofT Digital Curation Institute. At its current infancy stage, Curbcut has the potential to support addressing climate and social justice issues. As designers of Curbcut, we recognize the importance of critically examining design approaches of such a tool and its impact on local communities.

# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-microscope" %} Introducing Just Sustainability Design
### Computing is insolvent: unable to pay its debts to our planet and its societies. JSD reorients tech work so we can build a better future together.

## What is Just Sustainability Design
Just Sustainability Design, JSD for short, is a framework for systems design practice, research, and pedagogy that privileges sustainability and justice and therefore, the asymmetric and uneven effects of systems design choices at a distance. JSD aims to bring about improvement, not just avoid damage. 

## Principles of Just Sustainability Design

Constructive and Critical

Systemic
