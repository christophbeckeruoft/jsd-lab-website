{% include section.html %}

We are faculty members and students of the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. The aim of the Just Sustainability Desng lab is to help shift our world on a more sustainable and just course through impactful research and community centered action. A key principle is that each project we engage in has the *potential* to make a real difference to that end, and **some actually do.**
