>#### Conflict, n.
>
> Something that does not match up and needs to be fixed. Typically identified between (a) alternative design solutions for a given problem easily addressed by identifying and modelling the costs, benefits and risks and then trading them off rationally to select the optimum choice (that’s what engineers do); or (b) between development branches. (May the wrath of the gods be upon you in eternity while you slowly roast in hell.) Other forms of conflict are invalid and irrational.

>#### Facts, n. pl.

> Claims made about the environment of technology design for which those who make them forgot to question where they came from, how they came about, which values they embody, whose values these are, whose facts they are, and whose interest that serves.

>#### Goal Modeling, n.

> The illusion that everything that matters can be represented as an instrumental achievement to be met; the delusion that anything that can not be represented as an instrumental achievement to be met cannot possibly matter. Both are common in requirements engineering.
